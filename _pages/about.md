Hi, this is ***Yunnuo (Noah) Zhang***.

I am currently a senior year student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) majoring in Computer Science, where I am advised by [Dr. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm) and [Dr. Melody Jackson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~melody/). Currently, I am working as a research assistant intern at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu) with [Dr. Jinxing Li](https://www.labli.net). 

I am interested in **brain-computer interface**, **electrophysiological sensing** and **bio-electronic** researches. I am not only interested but enthusiastic in transforming clinical and medical into everyday wearable technologies to help reduce the load of medical providers and provide day-to-day healthcare to the public.
