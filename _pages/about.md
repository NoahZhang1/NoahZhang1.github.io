Hi, this is ***Yunnuo (Noah) Zhang***.

I am currently a first year Master student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) majoring in Computer Science, where I am advised by [Dr. Chethan Pandarinath] at snel(https://www.snel.ai) and BrainGate(https://www.braingate.org). I was honored to advised by [Dr. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm) and [Dr. Melody Jackson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~melody/) during my undergraduate, where I finished my thesis on wearable EEG-SSVEP sensors and pipeline. I also worked as a research assistant intern at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu) with [Dr. Jinxing Li](https://www.labli.net), whom I was advised by with during my previous experience at Stanford University, Bao Group.

I am interested in **brain-computer interface**, **wearable technology** and **bio-electronic** researches. I am not only interested but enthusiastic in transforming clinical and medical into everyday wearable technologies to help reduce the load of medical providers and provide day-to-day healthcare to the public, which includes but not limit to
<ul style="font-size: 14px;">
  <li>Develop high performance wearable interfaces to achieve imperceivable electrophysiological and electrochemical sensing in wearabing environment.</li>
  <li>Invasive brain-computer interfaces and real time monitoring of ECoG or intracortical neural signal, enabing a more complex wearable modality or even close-loop simulation.</li>
  <li>Integrate more complex and universal sensing modalities to achieve integrated and combined sensing systems, including EEG, EMG, EOG, ECG, glucose, lactate or even hormone.</li>
  <li>Machine learning on wearable data, data processing and analysis pipeline on personal health profile with wearable sensing data.</li>
</ul>

I am **Tri-lingual**, feel free to check site in any of the language shown above.
