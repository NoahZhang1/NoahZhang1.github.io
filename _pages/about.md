Hi, this is ***Yunnuo (Noah) Zhang***.

I am currently a senior year student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) majoring in Computer Science, where I am advised by [Dr. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm) and [Dr. Melody Jackson](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~melody/). Currently, I am working as a research assistant intern at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu) with [Dr. Jinxing Li](https://www.labli.net). 

I am interested in **brain-computer interface**, **electrophysiological sensing** and **bio-electronic** researches. I am not only interested but enthusiastic in transforming clinical and medical into everyday wearable technologies to help reduce the load of medical providers and provide day-to-day healthcare to the public.

<!-- I am interested in combining sensors and haptics to develop wearable technology that monitors and modulates physical or behavioral health without requiring attention. Contrary to current commercial and clinical health devices, I aim to minimize the need for daily tasks and reminders for health improvements. Towards this end, I've designed brain-computer interfaces and haptic gloves for daily wear while broadly drawing from past research in human-computer interaction, machine learning and neuroscience. My research has been published in top human-computer interaction venues such as ACM CHI and UbiComp. -->
<!-- I'm interested in developing **symbiotic interfaces**, devices that integrate with their users' physiology while learning alongside them to augment their abilities. I study and design wearable technology using sensors and haptics for **new interaction techniques** and **faster skill acquisition**, broadly drawing from influences across human-computer interaction, machine learning and neuroscience. My research has been published in top human-computer interaction venues such as ACM CHI and UbiComp. -->

<!-- I serve as the [BCI Society](https://bcisociety.org/) Postdoc and Student Committee Chair and as a member of the [Futuring SIGCHI Committee](https://sigchi.org/people/committees/#futuring-sigchi-committee). 

Previously, I did my undergraduate at Georgia Tech, where I built haptic gloves and subtle interfaces as a research assistant for wearable computing pioneer [Dr. Thad Starner](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/thad/index.htm). I've also worked with the [Audio and Acoustics group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/audio-and-acoustics-research-group/) at Microsoft Research, investigating brain-computer interfaces for VR/AR and tongue interactions. -->
